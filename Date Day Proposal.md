# Capstone Step 2 Project Proposal

**Mike Panaiotti**

## What tech stack will you use for your final project?

#### We recommend that you use React and Node for this project, however, if you are extremely interested in becoming a Python developer you are welcome to use Python/Flask for this project.

I would say python/flask because this is what I know. I do not know React and or Node. However, this may change after some more finality to React and Node.

## Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?

I would hope to work with this project more in a full-stack application.

## Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?

I think this could work as both. A website would be nice for more planning in advance and allowing users to feel more comfortable and calm while searching. When it comes to mobile it would be nice as a companion to dating apps and for people in a pinch of what to do.

## What goal will your project be designed to achieve?

My project would be designed to help users find plans for a date both romanticly or otherwise. I hope to recommend users events restaurants and more based on their location and likes. To avoid this being a CRUD app I would focus more on interactivity with the users. Having them like things they enjoy. Also updating the events around them. As well as allowing users to set a “date day” and giving suggestions leading up to that date.

## What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?

I think this demographic would work well with people in cities. Allowing users to search out things to do that they may not have known before. This will also be for anyone trying to enter a romantic partner or others in their life. It may be good for finding activities for people with children as well if we could have filters for this kind go data.

## What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?

#### You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack are required to create your own API.

I am not 100% sure what API I should use but I think Google Books would be a good API because it has books in its entirety. And I think that my be what is necessary for this app's unique function. Other Wise it would be a CRUD app.
