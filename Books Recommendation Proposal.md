# Capstone Step 2 Project Proposal

**Mike Panaiotti**

## What tech stack will you use for your final project?

#### We recommend that you use React and Node for this project, however if you are extremely interested in becoming a Python developer you are welcome to use Python/Flask for this project.

I would say python/flask because this is what I know. I do not know React and or Node. However, this may change after some more finality to React and Node.

## Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?

I would hope to work with this project more in a full-stack application.

## Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?

I hope for there two to be both however, the mobile app would be better right now. As a companion to an app like Libby or e-book/audiobook sights.

## What goal will your project be designed to achieve?

My goal is to use AI and the library on Google Books or another e-book to give user recommendations for novels based not on a comparative algorithm but on the content of the books. Having used Log their Books and Save others they would like. I hope to be able to find books easily based on similar writing styles, plot progression, and or use of tropes. They are having Ai find these similarities between full Books and giving the users recommendations on what they enjoy.

## What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?

I would say that the kind of users that would use my app would be readers of any kind. I currently work at a library and there is a job many of the libraries do is finding books based on users' enjoyment and or need. This app could answer those questions for users or assist libraries in making a proper choice for a user.

## What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?

#### You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack are required to create your own API.

I am not 100% sure what API I should use but I think Google Books would be a good API because it has books in its entirety. And I think that my be what is necessary for this app's unique function. Other Wise it would be a CRUD app.
